## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Getting more comfortable using `position: relative` and `position: absolute` for positioning (duh). Also the use of `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.

### Continued development

`overflow: hidden` doesn't seem to be working on the x-axis while using Safari iOS üì± (but it works while using Safari macOS). Gotta check that for later.

Thanks, Apple üçé.

This is where you can give a hat tip to anyone who helped you out on this project. Perhaps you worked in a team or got some inspiration from someone else's solution. This is the perfect place to give them some credit.

Thanks to [@elaineleung](https://github.com/elaineleung) for her reference on how to add the pattern background images using the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements, and `position: absolute` for positioning.
